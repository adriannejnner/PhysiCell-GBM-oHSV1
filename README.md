# PhysiCell-GBM-oHSV1
Code from A.L. Jenner et al. (2020) "Stromal density shapes response to HSV-1 oncolytic virotherapy in glioblastoma" (Submitted to Cancer Research). 

The model in this repository was built using PhysiCell (physicell.org) and models the administration of an oncolytic virus oHSV-1 in a glioblastoma fragment made up of GBM tumour cells and stromal cells. 

To run, download the full code and make 'GBM-OV-immune-stroma-patchy'.
